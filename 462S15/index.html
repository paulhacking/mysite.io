<b>Course description</b>
<p>
This course is a continuation of Math 461. We will begin by studying the symmetries of the plane and the sphere. Then we will construct the hyperbolic plane and study its geometry. The hyperbolic plane is a curved surface with many amazing properties. For example, the circumference of a circle drawn on the hyperbolic plane grows exponentially as the radius increases.
