<br>
Monday 5/3/10. Review session for final exam.
<br>
<br>
Friday 4/30/10. We finished the description of rotations in 3 dimensions in terms of the quaternions. We used this to understand the geometry of the group SO(3) of rotations in 3 dimensions.
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 4/28/10. We introduced the quaternions and showed how they can be used to compute compositions of rotations in 3 dimensions.
<br>
<br>
Monday 4/26/10. We finished the proof of the classification of finite groups of rotations in 3 dimensions and realized each type as the group of rotational symmetries of a polyhedron. We filled out class evaluations.
<br>
<br>
Friday 4/23/10. We deduced that the finite rotation groups in 3 dimensions are either cyclic, dihedral, or the group of rotational symmetries of a regular polyhedron (tetrahedron, cube/octahedron, or dodecahedron/icosahedron).  
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 4/21/10. We derived the counting formula for finite rotation groups in 3 dimensions, relating the order of the group and the order of the stabilizer for each orbit of poles.
<br>
<br>
Monday 4/19/10. No class (Patriots' day).
<br>
<br>
Friday 4/16/10. We identified the full group of symmetries of the dodecahedron as A<sub>5</sub>xZ<sub>2</sub> using the 5 inscribed cubes together with the determinant. We began to study finite groups of rotations in 3 dimensions.
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 4/14/10. We identified the group of rotational symmetries of the dodecahedron with the alternating group A<sub>5</sub> using the 5 inscribed cubes.
<br>
<br>
Monday 4/12/10. We finished the description of the symmetries of the cube.
<br>
<br>
Friday 4/9/10. We introduced the alternating group A<sub>n</sub> (the subgroup of S<sub>n</sub> consisting of even permutations) and began to describe the symmetries of the cube (or equivalently, its dual the octahedron). 
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 4/7/10. We described the cycle notation for permutations and the sign of a permutation.
<br>
<br>
Monday 4/5/10. We recalled the definition of the symmetric group S<sub>n</sub> and showed that it is generated by transpositions. We identified the group of symmetries of a tetrahedron with S<sub>4</sub> by associating a symmetry with the induced permutation of the vertices. 
<br>
<br>
Friday 4/2/10. We gave another proof of Euler's formula using spherical geometry. We described the dihedral group D<sub>n</sub> of symmetries of a regular n-sided polygon.
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 3/31/10. We proved Euler's formula V-E+F=2 for polyhedra by an inductive argument.
<br>
<br>
Monday 3/29/10. We finished the description of the icosahedron in coordinates and obtained the dodecahedron as its dual. We discussed spherical projections of polyhedra. 
<br>
<br>
Friday 3/26/10. We began the construction of the icosahedron in coordinates and discussed the golden ratio.
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 3/24/10. We described the cube and octahedron in coordinates. We discussed duality of polyhedra.
<br>
<br>
Monday 3/22/10. We proved that the list of regular polyhedra below is complete.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Monday 3/8/10. We compared spherical geometry and Euclidean plane geometry (3.5,3.6).
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Wednesday 3/3/10. We worked out examples of motions of the sphere (3.4).

Friday 2/26/10. We discussed basic notions of spherical geometry (3.1).
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 2/24/10. No class due to snow day.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
