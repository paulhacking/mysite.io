<b>Course description</b>
<p>
This course is a continuation of Math 461: Geometry I. We study euclidean and spherical geometry, with particular emphasis on the group of symmetries in each case.

<br>

<b>Textbook</b>
<p>
The course text is <i>Geometry and Topology</i> by Miles Reid and Balazs Szendroi. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SO1oNBjt5hMC&dq=szendroi+reid&source=gbs_navlinks_s">googlebooks</a>.
</p>
<p>
We will also use the text from Math 461, <i>Modern Geometries</i>, 2nd ed., by Michael Henle. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FGXGQgAACAAJ&dq=henle+geometries&cd=2">googlebooks</a>
</p>
<p>
It is important to read the textbook as well as attending the lectures -- there is not enough time in class to cover all the material.
</p>
<br>

<b>Homework</b>
<p>
There will be weekly homework, due at the beginning of Friday's class (first homework due 2/5/10).
</p>
<p>
The homework and quizzes make up 35% of your course grade.

<br>

<b>Exams</b>
<p>
There will be one midterm exam and one final exam. 
</p>
<p>
The midterm exam will be held on Wednesday 3/10/10 at 7PM in LGRT 0113.
There will be a review session on Tuesday 3/9/10 at 7PM in LGRT 121. Midterm review questions are 
<a href="http://www.math.umass.edu/~hacking/462S10/homework/MTrev.pdf">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The final exam will be held on Tuesday 5/11/10 at 10:30AM in LGRT 321. 
There will be a review session on Monday 5/10/10 at 7PM in LGRT 121. Final review questions are 
<a href="http://www.math.umass.edu/~hacking/462S10/homework/Finalrev.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Calculators and the textbook are <em>not</em> allowed on exams and quizzes. You are allowed one sheet of notes (8.5x11, both sides).
</p>

<p>
The exams make up 65% of your course grade -- 30% for the midterm and 35% for the final.

<b>Syllabus</b>
<br>
<br>
Numbers refer to sections of the course text Geometry and Topology by Reid and Szendroi.
<br>
<br>
1 Euclidean geometry: Metric (distance function), classification of motions (symmetries). Sample theorems of plane geometry.
<br>
<br>
2 Composition of maps: Examples. Reflections generate all Euclidean motions.
<br>

3 Spherical geometry: Metric, triangles, and classification of motions. Comparison of spherical and Euclidean geometry.
<br>
<br>
Polyhedra: Examples. The regular polyhedra: classification and description in coordinates. Duality of polyhedra. 
Euler's formula V-E+F=2.
<br>
<br>
Symmetry groups: The dihedral group of symmetries of a regular n-sided polygon. 
The symmetric group S<sub>n</sub> of permutations of n objects. Cycle notation for permutations. 
Generation of S<sub>n</sub> by transpositions, the sign of a permutation, 
the alternating group A<sub>n</sub> of even permutations. The symmetry groups of the regular polyhedra: 
explicit geometric description and algebraic description via permutation groups. 
Finite groups of rotations in R<sup>3</sup> : classification and examples.
