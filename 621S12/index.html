<b>Grading</b>:
Your course grade will be computed as follows: Homework 30%, Midterm 30%, Final 40%.
<br>
<br>

<b>Overview of course</b>
<p>
We will cover the basic theory of functions of one complex variable, at a pace that will allow for the inclusion of some non-elementary topics at the end. Basic Theory: Holomorphic functions, conformal mappings, Cauchy's Theorem and consequences, Taylor and Laurent series, singularities, residues, elliptic functions, other topics as time permits.
