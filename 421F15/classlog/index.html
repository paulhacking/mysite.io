<h2> Class Log </h2>


Friday 12/11/15: More examples of the mapping problem. Statement of the Riemann mapping theorem. Brief discussion of the Schwarz--Christoffel formula describing a mapping from the upper half plane to the interior of a rectangle.
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 12/9/15: The mapping problem: given open sets U and V of the complex plane, find a complex differentiable function g: U --> V which is one-to-one and onto. 
Given such a function g, the derivative g' is nowhere zero on U, so that (1) g preserves angles and (2) the inverse of g is also complex differentiable. Examples using elementary functions.

<br>
Monday 12/7/15: Another example: using an LFT to map the region bounded by two circles meeting at right angles to the positive quadrant. Proofs of properties of LFT's stated last time.
<br>
<br>
Friday 12/4/15: Linear fractional transformations f(z)=(az+b)/(cz+d). LFT's are invertible functions from the extended complex plane (the complex numbers together with the point &infin;) to itself. If C is a circle or line then f(C) is a circle or line. If A,B,C are 3 distinct complex numbers, then the LFT f(z)=((Z-A)/(Z-B))/((C-A)/(C-B)) maps A,B, and C to 0, &infin;, and 1. Example: The LFT f(z)=-i(z-1)/(z+1) maps the disc with center the origin and radius 1 to the upper half plane.

Wednesday 12/2/15: Application to fluid flow. For an incompressible irrotational 2-dimensional flow the velocity field is given by grad &phi; for some harmonic function &phi;. If f= &phi; + i &psi; is complex differentiable, then the level curves of &psi; give the streamlines of the flow (the paths of particles in the fluid). Solution of fluid flow problems by using a complex differentiable function to map the original domain to a simpler domain.

<br>
Monday 11/30/15: Harmonic functions. If f=u+iv is complex differentiable then u and v are harmonic. Conversely if u is harmonic on a simply connected domain U then u is the real part of a complex differentiable function on U.

<br>
<br>
Friday 10/30/15: Generalized Cauchy integral formula (Cauchy integral formula for derivatives). Consequences: f complex differentiable implies f has complex derivatives of all orders. Liouville's theorem: Suppose f is a complex differentiable function with domain the whole complex plane. If f is bounded then f is constant.
