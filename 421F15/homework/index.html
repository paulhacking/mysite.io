Corrections to homework solutions (thanks to my grader):<br>
HW1Q4b: There's an arithmetic error, the correct answer is z= 2+3i or 2-3i.<br>
HW4Q1d: In the solution u and v are accidentally switched. Correcting this, we find u and v do satisfy the Cauchy--Riemann equations (and their partial derivatives are continuous) so f is complex differentiable.
