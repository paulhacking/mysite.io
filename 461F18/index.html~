<b>Course description</b>
<p>
We will explore several approaches to geometry: constructions with straight-edge and compass, the axiomatic approach of Euclid and Hilbert, analytic geometry via linear algebra, and Klein's approach using symmetries and transformations. This will open the doors to many non-Euclidean flavors of geometry. Projective and spherical geometry will be studied in some detail.
