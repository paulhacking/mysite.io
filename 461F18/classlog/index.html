Wednesday 12/12/18. Classification of hyperbolic isometries: identity, hyperbolic reflections, hyperbolic rotations, horolations, hyperbolic translations, and hyperbolic glide reflections. Algebraic formula T(z)=(az+b)/(cz+d) for orientation preserving hyperbolic isometries (where a,b,c,d are real numbers and ad-bc>0). Lecture notes <a href="lecture_notes/L12_12.pdf">pdf</a>.

<br>
Monday 12/10/18. For L a hyperbolic line, if L is a vertical line then hyperbolic reflection in L coincides with Euclidean reflection in L; if L is a semicircle then hyperbolic reflection in L is given by inversion in L. Every hyperbolic isometry is a composite of at most 3 reflections. Lecture notes <a href="lecture_notes/L12_10.pdf">pdf</a>.

Friday 12/7/18. Hyperbolic lines give shortest paths. Inversion in the unit circle takes circles and lines to circles and lines (and the image of a circle or line C is a circle iff C contains the origin). Inversion preserves angles. Given a hyperbolic line L and a point P there is a unique hyperbolic line M through P perpendicular to L. Lecture notes <a href="lecture_notes/L12_7.pdf">pdf</a>.

Wednesday 12/5/18. A hyperbolic line is a vertical half line or a semicircle with center on the x-axis in the upper half plane. For any two points P and Q in H there is a unique hyperbolic line through P and Q. Theorem: The shortest path from P to Q is the segment of the hyperbolic line connecting P and Q. The Theorem is proved by reducing to the case of vertical half lines considered earlier using hyperbolic isometries. A hyperbolic isometry is a transformation T:H->H that preserves hyperbolic distances, that is, d<sub>H</sub>(T(P),T(Q))=d<sub>H</sub>(P,Q) for all P,Q in H. Examples of hyperbolic isometries: translations parallel to the x axis T(x,y)=(x+a,y); scaling by a factor c > 0 T(x,y)=(cx,cy); reflection in the y-axis T(x,y)=(-x,y) (or reflection in any vertical line); inversion in the unit circle T(x,y)=(x,y)/(x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>). The inversion T in the unit circle has fixed locus the unit circle x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>=1 and interchanges the inside and outside of the unit circle. The composition T<sup>2</sup> equals the identity. We will interpret T:H->H later as the hyperbolic reflection in the hyperbolic line given by the unit semicircle.

Monday 12/3/18. Hyperbolic geometry. The upper half plane model H. The (hyperbolic) length of a curve in H is defined as the integral of &radic;(x'<sup>2</sup>+y'<sup>2</sup>)/y over the domain [a,b] of a parametrization (x(t),y(t)) of the curve. The (hyperbolic) distance d<sub>H</sub>(P,Q) is the length of the shortest path from P to Q. The shortest path between two points P=(c,a), Q=(c,b) in H lying on a vertical line (x=c) is the segment of the vertical line connecting them, and the distance  d<sub>H</sub>(P,Q)=ln(b/a) (assuming WLOG a < b).

Friday 11/30/18. Stereographic projection sends spherical circles not passing through the north pole N to circles in the plane. Spherical lines (great circles) on the sphere correspond under stereographic projection to circles or lines in the plane which intersect the unit circle in two antipodal points.

Wednesday 11/28/18. Proof of formula describing distortion of lengths under stereographic projection. Stereographic projection preserves angles.

Monday 11/26/18. Algebraic formulas for stereographic projection and its inverse: F(x,y,z)=(x,y)/(1-z) and F<sup>-1</sup>(u,v)=(2u,2v,u<sup>2</sup>+v<sup>2</sup>-1)/(u<sup>2</sup>+v<sup>2</sup>+1). Relation between the length of a curve on S<sup>2</sup> and the length of its image in R<sup>2</sup> under stereographic projection via the formula &radic;(x'<sup>2</sup>+y'<sup>2</sup>+z'<sup>2</sup>) = (2/(u<sup>2</sup>+v<sup>2</sup>+1))*&radic;(u'<sup>2</sup>+v'<sup>2</sup>). Example: computation of length for a line of longitude (a spherical line through the north and south poles) in terms of its stereographic projection (a line throught the origin in the plane).

Friday 11/16/18. Isometries of S<sup>2</sup>: A composition of 3 reflections is a rotary reflection. Compositions of rotations. A composition of two rotations of S<sup>2</sup> is another rotation; the axis and angle can be computed by drawing a spherical triangle (similar to the case of compositions of rotations in R<sup>2</sup> discussed on 10/12/18). Isometries of S<sup>2</sup> (or equivalently isometries of R<sup>3</sup> fixing the origin) correspond to 3 x 3 orthogonal matrices, and the classification of isometries can be understood in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix. In particular, the determinant of the matrix is +1 for the identity and rotations and -1 for reflections and rotary reflections. Stereographic projection.

Wednesday 11/14/18. Classification of isometries of R<sup>3</sup> fixing the origin (or equivalently isometries of the sphere S<sup>2</sup>): identity, reflection, rotation, or rotary reflection. GPS theorem: A point P in S<sup>2</sup> is uniquely determined by its distance from 3 points A,B,C not lying on a spherical line. (This uses a Lemma: the perpendicular bisector of a spherical line segment PQ is the locus of points that are equidistant from P and Q). Corollary: A spherical isometry T is determined by T(A),T(B),T(C) for 3 points A,B,C not lying on a spherical line. Theorem: (3 reflections theorem) A spherical isometry is a composite of at most 3 reflections. The classification follows based on the number of reflections ---  0: identity, 1: reflection, 2: rotation (more precisely, the axis of rotation is the intersection of the two planes of reflection and the angle of rotation is twice the dihedral angle between the planes, measured from the first plane to the second), 3: rotary reflection (proof to be completed on Friday).

Friday 11/9/18. Isometries of R<sup>3</sup> fixing the origin: given an algebraic formula T(x)=Ax for T (where A is a 3x3 matrix), we determine a geometric description. First, compute the fixed locus of T: it is either (1) R<sup>3</sup> (2) a plane through the origin (3) a line through the origin or (4) the origin. In case (1) T is the identity. In case (2) T is reflection in the plane. In case (3) T is rotation about the line through angle t determined by 2 cos t + 1 = trace(A). In case (4) T is a rotary reflection: a reflection in a plane through the origin followed by a rotation about the line through the origin perpendicular to the plane. To find the axis of rotation solve T(x)=-x. The angle of rotation t is determined by 2 cos t -1 = trace(A). The plane of reflection is the plane through the origin perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Note that the trace of a matrix M is the sum of its diagonal entries, and trace(PMP<sup>-1</sup>)=trace(M) for an invertible matrix P (this was used to determine the angles of rotation above).

Friday 11/2/18. The spherical sine rule (continued). Spherical isometries. An isometry of R<sup>3</sup> fixing the origin induces a isometry of the sphere.

Friday 10/19/18. Spherical geometry. A spherical line is by definition the intersection of the sphere with a plane through its center (also called a great circle). The shortest path between two points on the sphere is given by the shorter arc of the spherical line through the two points (proof later). The angle between two spherical lines meeting at a point is by definition the angle between the tangent lines to the spherical lines at that point, equivalently, the dihedral angle between the corresponding planes, or the angle between the normal vectors to the planes.
