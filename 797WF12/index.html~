<b>Prerequisites</b>
<br>
<br>
I will try to keep these to a minimum.  To some extent I will tailor the course to the participants.<br>
<i>Required</i>: Basic commutative algebra and complex analysis (as covered
in 611-612, 621), notion of smooth manifold, differential forms (as
covered in 703,704).<br>
<i>Useful, but not required</i>: Basic algebraic topology (fundamental group,
homology, cohomology).

<b>Overview of course</b>
<br>
<br>
Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric spaces defined by polynomial equations. It is a central topic in mathematics with strong ties to differential and symplectic geometry, topology, number theory, and representation theory. It is also a very important source of examples throughout mathematics. The aim of this course will be to learn algebraic geometry through the study of key examples. Topics will include homogeneous spaces (projective space, Grassmannian), curves (elliptic, hyperelliptic, plane curves, genus),and surfaces (rational, ruled, K3, Enriques, blowup of a point).
