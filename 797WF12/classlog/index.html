Friday 11/16/12. If X is a smooth projective curve and f is a non-constant morphism from X to a variety Y, then X is a finite morphism. Moreover, WLOG assume Y=f(X),
and let U be an open affine subset of Y with coordinate ring A. Then the open subset f<sup>-1</sup>(U) of X is affine with coordinate ring the integral closure of f*(A) in the function field of X. 
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 11/14/12. Curves. If X is a curve and P is a smooth point of X then the local ring O<sub>X,P</sub> is a discrete valuation ring. 
If U is a Zariski open subset of a smooth curve X, Y is a projective variety, and f is a morphism from U to Y, then f extends (uniquely) to a morphism from X to Y.
Corollary: If X and Y are smooth projective curves with isomorphic functions fields (equivalently, X and Y are birational), then X and Y are isomorphic.
