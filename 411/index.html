<b>Course text</b>: <em>A first course in abstract algebra</em>, by J. B. Fraleigh, 7th ed., Addison-Wesley 2002. <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&q=fraleigh+abstract+algebra&sqi=2&cid=4734241335816502479#p" >googlebooks</a>.

<b>Overview of course</b>
<p>
This course is an introduction to group theory, which is one of the oldest branches of modern algebra. It was invented by a 19-year-old Evariste Galois with a goal of proving that there is no algebraic formula expressing the roots of an equation of degree 5 in terms of its coefficients. Since then, group theory has become the crucial tool in uncovering hidden symmetries of the world. The emphasis of this class will be on using concrete examples to develop problem-solving and proof-writing skills. We will cover permutations, cyclic and Abelian groups, cosets and Lagrange's theorem, quotient groups, and group actions.
