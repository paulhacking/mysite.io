Monday 11/4/19. Spherical geometry. We write S<sup>2</sup> for the sphere with center the origin and radius 1 in R<sup>3</sup>, with equation x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>+z<sup>2</sup>=1. A spherical line or great circle is the intersection of the sphere S<sup>2</sup> with a plane passing through the origin. There is a spherical line passing through any two points P and Q on the sphere, and it is unique unless P and Q are antipodal. The shortest path on the sphere between two points P and Q is the shorter segment of the spherical line connecting the two points (Proof later). Formula for the spherical distance from P to Q (the length of the shortest path) using the dot product.

Friday 11/1/19. Every isometry of the plane is either the identity, a translation, a rotation, a reflection, or a glide reflection. (Proof using the 3 reflections theorem.) Lecture notes <a href="lecture_notes/11_1.pdf">pdf</a>.
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 10/30/19. Two triangles are congruent if and only if there is an isometry sending the first triangle to the second. Every isometry is the composition of at most 3 reflections. Lecture notes <a href="lecture_notes/10_30.pdf">pdf</a>. 
<br>
<br>
Monday 10/28/19. GPS theorem: Given 3 points in the plane, not lying on a line, any point in the plane is determined by its distances from the 3 given points. Lecture notes <a href="lecture_notes/10_28.pdf">pdf</a>.
<br>
<br>
Friday 10/25/19. Compositions of isometries: The composition of a rotation and a translation is a rotation through the same angle about another point. The composition of two rotations about a point P is a rotation about P through the sum of the angles. The composition of two rotations about different points P and Q is a rotation about another point R through the sum of the angles (or a translation). Lecture notes <a href="lecture_notes/10_25.pdf">pdf</a>. Please note: I made an error in the lecture which is reproduced in the lecture notes: a rotation through angle t about a point P is given by the composition of reflections in lines L and M intersecting at P at angle t/2 (not t).

<br>
<br>
Wednesday 10/23/19. Determining the geometric description of an isometry from its algebraic formula: Examples. Compositions of isometries: A composition of two translations is another translation. A composition of two reflections in parallel lines is a translation by twice the vector from the first line to the second (perpendicular to the lines). A composition of two reflections in intersecting lines is a rotation about the intersection point through twice the angle from the first line to the second.
