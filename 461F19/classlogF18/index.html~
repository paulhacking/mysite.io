Wednesday 11/14/18. Classification of isometries of R<sup>3</sup> fixing the origin (or equivalently isometries of the sphere S<sup>2</sup>): identity, reflection, rotation, or rotary reflection. GPS theorem: A point P in S<sup>2</sup> is uniquely determined by its distance from 3 points A,B,C not lying on a spherical line. (This uses a Lemma: the perpendicular bisector of a spherical line segment PQ is the locus of points that are equidistant from P and Q). Corollary: A spherical isometry T is determined by T(A),T(B),T(C) for 3 points A,B,C not lying on a spherical line. Theorem: (3 reflections theorem) A spherical isometry is a composite of at most 3 reflections. The classification follows based on the number of reflections ---  0: identity, 1: reflection, 2: rotation (more precisely, the axis of rotation is the intersection of the two planes of reflection and the angle of rotation is twice the dihedral angle between the planes, measured from the first plane to the second), 3: rotary reflection (proof to be completed on Friday).

Friday 11/9/18. Isometries of R<sup>3</sup> fixing the origin: given an algebraic formula T(x)=Ax for T (where A is a 3x3 matrix), we determine a geometric description. First, compute the fixed locus of T: it is either (1) R<sup>3</sup> (2) a plane through the origin (3) a line through the origin or (4) the origin. In case (1) T is the identity. In case (2) T is reflection in the plane. In case (3) T is rotation about the line through angle t determined by 2 cos t + 1 = trace(A). In case (4) T is a rotary reflection: a reflection in a plane through the origin followed by a rotation about the line through the origin perpendicular to the plane. To find the axis of rotation solve T(x)=-x. The angle of rotation t is determined by 2 cos t -1 = trace(A). The plane of reflection is the plane through the origin perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Note that the trace of a matrix M is the sum of its diagonal entries, and trace(PMP<sup>-1</sup>)=trace(M) for an invertible matrix P (this was used to determine the angles of rotation above).

Friday 11/2/18. The spherical sine rule (continued). Spherical isometries. An isometry of R<sup>3</sup> fixing the origin induces a isometry of the sphere. Examples of isometries of the sphere: reflection in a plane through the origin, rotation about a line through the origin, rotary reflection (reflection in a plane throught the origin followed by a rotation about the line through the origin perpendicular to the plane). Every isometry of the sphere is either the identity, a reflection, a rotation, or a rotary reflection (proof later). Lecture notes <a href="lecture_notes/L11_2.pdf">pdf</a>.

Friday 10/19/18. Spherical geometry. A spherical line is by definition the intersection of the sphere with a plane through its center (also called a great circle). The shortest path between two points on the sphere is given by the shorter arc of the spherical line through the two points (proof later). The angle between two spherical lines meeting at a point is by definition the angle between the tangent lines to the spherical lines at that point, equivalently, the dihedral angle between the corresponding planes, or the angle between the normal vectors to the planes.
