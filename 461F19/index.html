<b>Course description</b>
<p>
We will explore several approaches to geometry: constructions with straight-edge and compass, the axiomatic approach of Euclid and Hilbert, the coordinate geometry of Descartes, and Klein's approach using symmetries and transformations. This will open the doors to many non-Euclidean flavors of geometry.

<b>Exams</b>
<p>
There will be one midterm exam and one final exam.
</p>
<p>
You are allowed one sheet of notes (letter-size, both sides) on the exams. Calculators, additional notes, and the textbook are <em>not</em> allowed on the exams. You should bring your student ID (UCard) to each exam.

I also taught this class in Fall 2018. The 2018 course webpage is <a href="http://people.math.umass.edu/~hacking/461F18/index.html">here</a>. It includes a complete class log with lecture notes and past homeworks and exams. (I have removed access to homework and exam solutions however.) The Fall 2019 course will be similar (but I do plan to make some changes).

Instructions for constructing a paper model of the hyperbolic plane: <br>
Print out <a href="hyperbolic_paper.pdf">this page</a> and make several photocopies. Cut out the collar regions and build the surface by successively attaching the inside of one collar to the outside of another and also attaching the collars end to end. (I used small pieces of sticky tape to do this; if you put the tape all on one side you'll be able to draw with a pencil on the other side.) When you have made a reasonably large surface you will find that the edge of the surface is wavy (so that the edge is longer than if the surface was flat). Now put the surface on a table, take a ruler and press one edge of the ruler down on the surface so that the surface touches the table along the edge of the ruler, and draw a line on the surface with a pencil. This line is a hyperbolic line in the hyperbolic plane. If you draw 3 lines forming a hyperbolic triangle you will be able to see that the sum a+b+c of the angles of the triangle is less than pi. In fact pi-(a+b+c) is proportional to the area of the triangle (and in the mathematical study of the hyperbolic plane we choose units so that we have equality here).
