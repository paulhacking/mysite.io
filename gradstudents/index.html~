<b>Suggested reading in algebraic geometry</b>
<br>
<br>

<em>Introduction to algebraic curves</em>, by P. Griffiths. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yWceInduaV8C&dq=Phillip+Griffiths&source=gbs_navlinks_s">googlebooks</a>. 
<br>
An introduction to Riemann surfaces assuming only basic complex analysis.
<br>
<br>
<em>Principles of algebraic geometry</em>, by P. Griffiths and J. Harris. <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Principles_of_Algebraic_Geometry.html?id=-01YBAAAQBAJ">googlebooks</a>. 
<br>
Complex algebraic geometry from the analytic viewpoint. It is packed with instructive examples. It may be best to skim the foundations in Chapter 0 and refer back as needed. 
<br>
<br>
<em>Hodge theory and complex algebraic geometry I</em>, by C. Voisin. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mAM0SO0TIsUC&dq=editions:ISBN0521802830&source=gbs_navlinks_s">googlebooks</a>. 
<br>
Another treatment of the analytic approach. All the details are carefully explained here, but there are fewer examples. It is a good companion to Griffiths and Harris.
<br>
<br>
<em>Chapters on algebraic surfaces</em>, by M. Reid. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9602006">arxiv</a>. 
<br>
Notes from an (unconventional) first graduate course taught by Miles Reid at Park City summer school, with a strong emphasis on examples.
<br>
<br>

<em>Curves and their Jacobians</em>, by D. Mumford, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iVEQmzwjvjAC&dq=Curves+and+Jacobians&source=gbs_navlinks_s">googlebooks</a>. 
<br>
Text of 4 expository lectures on Riemann surfaces by Mumford. It is a mine of information. The level varies so be prepared to skip some parts. 
<br>
<br>
<em>Introduction to commutative algebra</em>, by M. Atiyah and I. MacDonald, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BLFaYTz1JxcC&dq=atiyah+and+macdonald&source=gbs_navlinks_s">googlebooks</a>. 
<br>
Classic reference on basic commutative algebra.
<br>
<br>
<em>Algebraic geometry</em>, by R. Hartshorne. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3rtX9t-nnvwC&dq=Hartshorne&source=gbs_navlinks_s">googlebooks</a>. 
<br>
The standard text on algebraic geometry as developed by Grothendieck. This approach is more technical but is necessary for arithmetic applications.
