<b>Textbook and Online homework</b>
<p>
The course text is <i>Linear algebra and its applications</i> (5th edition) by David Lay, Steven Lay, and Judi McDonald.
</p>
<p>
MyMathLab is required for this course. An electronic copy of the textbook is included in your purchase of MyMathLab ($75).
Go to www.mymathlab.com (<a href="http://www.mymathlab.com">link</a>) and use the Course ID for your own section (provided by your section's instructor).
</p>
<!--<p>
If you decide to purchase a physical copy of the textbook, be sure to also get MyMathLab for the 5th edition of the textbook.
There are options to purchase a hardcover or loose leaf version of the book together with MyMathLab (for example at amazon.com) at discounted rates negotiated with UMass.
To get these rates you must use the following ISBN numbers: 1323158820 (hardcover) or 1323158812 (loose leaf).
