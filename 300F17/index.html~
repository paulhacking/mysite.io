<b>Course text</b>: <em>Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof</em>, by T. Sundstrom, available for free download at the author's website <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mathematicalreasoning3ed/">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
Another useful text (not required) is <em>An introduction to mathematical thinking</em>, by W. Gilbert and S. Vanstone, Prentice Hall 2004. <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/An_introduction_to_mathematical_thinking.html?id=F8OEAAAACAAJ" >googlebooks</a>.
<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisites</b>: Math 132. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Overview of course</b>
<p>
The goal is that you learn to read, understand, and construct coherent, logically correct proofs, so that you may more easily make the transition from calculus to the more theoretical junior-senior courses, especially abstract algebra and modern analysis. Starting with explicit axioms and precisely stated definitions, you will systematically develop basic propositions about integers and modular arithmetic, induction and recursion, real numbers, infinite sets, and such other topics as time may allow. You will be provided with the needed background about logic, sets, and functions. For nearly every class you will create written mathematical proofs. You are expected to participate actively in class, including at the co-seminar.
</p>

<b>Syllabus</b>
<p>
We will cover Chapters 1--9 of the textbook.
