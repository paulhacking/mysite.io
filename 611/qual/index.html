<h2>Syllabus for Qualifying Exam in Algebra</h2>


<h3>I. Group Theory and Representation Theory.</h1>

Group actions. Counting with groups. P-groups and Sylow theorems. Composition series. Jordan-Holder theorem. Solvable groups. Automorphisms. Semi-direct products. Finitely generated Abelian groups. Complex representations of finite groups. Schur's Lemma. Maschke's Theorem. Representations of Abelian groups. Characters. Schur's orthogonality relations. The number of irreducible representations is equal to the number of conjugacy classes. The sum of squares of dimensions of irreducible representation is equal to the size of the group. The dimension of any irreducible representation divides the size of the group.
