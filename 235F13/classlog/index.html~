<br>
<br>
Wednesday 11/20/13: Complex eigenvalues. If A is a 2x2 matrix with complex (not real) eigenvalues then there is a basis B of R<sup>2</sup> such that the B-matrix of the linear transformation T(x)=Ax is a rotation-scaling matrix.

<br>
Friday 11/15/13: For A an nxn matrix, the characteristic polynomial f<sub>A</sub>(x)=det(A-xI) is a polynomial of degree n. So A has at most n eigenvalues. If A has n different eigenvalues then A is diagonalizable (there is a basis of R<sup>n</sup> consisting of eigenvectors of A).

<br>
<br>

Friday 11/8/13: 7.2 Finding the eigenvalues of a matrix. A real number c is an eigenvalue of a square matrix A <=> det(A-cI)=0 (the "characteristic equation"). We can solve this equation for c, then solve (A-cI)v=0 to find the corresponding eigenvectors v.
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 11/6/13: 7.1 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors. If T:R<sup>n</sup> -> R<sup>n</sup> is a linear transformation we say a nonzero vector v in R<sup>n</sup> is an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue c if T(v)=cv. Examples.

<br>
Wednesday 10/9/13: 3.3 Computing a basis of the image and kernel of a linear transformation. For a linear transformation T : R<sup>n</sup> -> R<sup>m</sup>, T(x)=Ax, the dimension of the image equals the number of pivots of RREF(A) (the rank of A) and the dimension of the kernel equals n-rank(A).

<br>
<br>
Wednesday 10/2/13: 3.1 The image and kernel of a linear transformation. The image is the span of the columns of the matrix of the linear transformation. For a linear transformation T, T(v)=T(w) precisely when the difference v-w lies in the kernel of T. In particular, T is one-to-one precisely when the kernel of T equals {0}.
