<b>Overview of course</b>
<p>
This course will be an introduction to ring and field theory. A ring is an algebraic system with two operations (addition and multiplication) satisfying various axioms, the basic example being the integers. We will see that many properties of the integers are shared by other broad classes of rings (for example polynomial rings). In particular we will explore the general notion of unique factorization and formulate conditions under which a ring has this property. Later in the course we will apply some of the results of ring theory to construct and study field extensions. If time permits we will outline the main results of Galois theory which studies the structure of the extension generated by the roots of a polynomial in terms of an associated group.
