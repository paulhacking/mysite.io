Friday 3/15/13. If K is a field, L is a field containing K, and a is an element of L, then the subring K[a] generated by a over K is a field iff a is algebraic over K. In general we write K(a) for the subfield generated by a over K, (so K(a) is the fraction field of K[a], and K(a)=K[a] iff a is algebraic over K). Computing inverses in K[a] (for a algebraic) using the identification of K[a] with K[x]/(f) and the Euclidean algorithm in K[x]. Examples: a = square root 2, a = cube root 2. 
If K is a field, L and M are fields containing K, and a in L and b in M are algebraic over K, then a and b have the same irreducible polynomial over K iff there is an isomorphism p: K(a) -> K(b) such that p(c)=c for all c in K and p(a)=b. Example: complex conjugation.

Wednesday 3/13/13. Let K be a field. The maximal ideals in K[x] are the principal ideals (f(x)) generated by irreducible polynomials (recall also that every ideal in K[x] is prinicipal). For f(x) in K[x] an irreducible polynomial, define the quotient ring L=K[y]/(f(y)). Then L is a field containing K and the element a=y+(f(y)) of L satisfies f(a)=0. The quotient ring L is a vector space over the field K with basis 1,y,y<sup>2</sup>,..,y<sup>n-1</sup> where n is the degree of f; in particular, the dimension of L as a vector space over K equals n. 
<br>
For K a field, L a field containing K, and a an element of L, we say a is algebraic over K if there is a nonzero polynomial g(x) in K[x] such that g(a)=0 (otherwise we say a is transcendental over K). In this case the irreducible polynomial of a over K is by definition the monic polynomial f(x) in K[x] of smallest degree such that f(a)=0. Then f is irreducible in K[x] and generates the kernel of the evaluation map p:K[x]-> L given by p(g(x))=g(a). So by the first isomorphism theorem we obtain an isomorphism p&#773: K[x]/(f) -> K[a], where K[a]:=p(K[x]) denotes the image of the evaluation map p.

Monday 3/11/13. Application of Eisenstein's criterion: The polynomial x<sup>n-1</sup>+x<sup>n-2</sup>+..+x+1=(x<sup>n</sup>-1)/(x-1) is irreducible iff n is a prime. Given a polynomial f in K[x] for some field K, construction of a field L containing K such that f has a root in L (Preliminary discussion).

Friday 3/8/13. Proof of Gauss' Lemma. Eisenstein's criterion: If f=a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup>+..+a<sub>0</sub> is a polynomial with integer coefficients and p is a prime such that p does not divide the leading coefficient a<sub>n</sub>, p divides the remaining coefficients a<sub>n-1</sub>,..,a<sub>0</sub>, and p<sup>2</sup> does not divide the last coefficient a<sub>0</sub>, then f is irreducible in Q[x]. Corollary: There exist irreducible polynomials in Q[x] of arbitrarily large degree.

Wednesday 3/6/13. Examples of factorizations of polynomials into irreducibles over various fields (Q,R,C,Z/pZ). Statement of Gauss' Lemma: If f is a polynomial with integer coefficients and we have a factorization f=gh where g and h are nonconstant polynomials with rational coefficients, then there is a factorization f=GH where G and H are nonconstant polynomials with integer coefficients. Application: If f=a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup>+..+a<sub>1</sub>x+a<sub>0</sub> is a polynomial with integer coefficients and p is a prime such that (1) p does not divide the leading coefficient a<sub>n</sub> and (2) the reduction f&#773; of f modulo p is irreducible in (Z/pZ)[x], then f is irreducible in Q[x].

Monday 3/4/13. If K is a field and f(x) in K[x] has degree 2 or 3, then f is irreducible iff there exists a in K such that f(a)=0. If f=a<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup>+..+a<sub>1</sub>x+a<sub>0</sub> is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and c=a/b is a rational number in its lowest terms such that f(c)=c, then b divides the leading coefficient a<sub>n</sub> of f and a divides the last coefficient a<sub>0</sub> of f. If K is a field and f(x) in K[x] is a nonzero polynomial, then there is a unique factorization f=cp<sub>1</sub>p<sub>2</sub>..p<sub>r</sub> where c in K is a nonzero constant and p<sub>1</sub>,..,p<sub>r</sub> are monic irreducible polynomials.

Friday 3/1/13. Example: Computing the gcd of two polynomials f,g in K[x], K a field, using the Euclidean algorithm. Irreducible polynomials: For K a field, we say f in K[x] is irreducible if f is not constant and there does not exist a factorization f=gh with g,h not constant. Irreducible polynomials for K=C (complex numbers) and K=R (real numbers). Irreducible polynomials over the finite field K=Z/pZ. The "sieve of Eratosthenes" method for listing irreducible polynomials over a finite field (same method used for listing primes in Z). There are irreducible polynomials of arbitrarily large degree over K=Z/pZ (following Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes in Z).

Wednesday 2/27/13. Corollaries of division algorithm: If g in R[x] satisfies g(a)=0 then g is divisible by (x-a). If R is an integral domain then a polynomial g in R[x] has at most deg(g) roots. (Application: the group of units in the field Z/pZ is cyclic.) If K is a field then every ideal in K[x] is principal. The gcd of two polynomials f,g in K[x]. 
<br>

Monday 2/25/13. If R is an integral domain then so is R[x]. (More precisely deg(fg)=deg(f)+deg(g) for nonzero polynomials f,g in R[x] when R is an integral domain.)
The division algorithm: Given f,g in R[x] such that f is nonzero and its leading coefficient is a unit in R, there are q,r in R[x] such that g=qf+r with r=0 or deg(r)< deg(f). Example: A polynomial ring in two variables x,y can be studied via R[x,y]=(R[x])[y].

Friday 2/22/13. The prime subfield of a field: If K is a field, then the characteristic of K equals 0 or p (a prime) and we get an injective homomorphism Q -> K in the first case and  Z/pZ -> K in the second. Theorem: A finite field has order p<sup>n</sup> for some prime p and positive integer n. Review of vector spaces from Math 235: Definition of a vector space V over a field F. Dimension of a vector space. If V is a vector space over a field F of dimension n then V is isomorphic to F<sup>n</sup>. The ring R[x] of polynomials in a variable x with coefficients in a ring R (commutative with 1).

Wednesday 2/20/13. Proof of Chinese remainder theorem. Example: R[x]/(x<sup>2</sup>-5x+4) is isomorphic to R &oplus; R (where R is the ring of real numbers). The fraction field of an integral domain. Examples: The fraction field of the ring R[x] of polynomials in the variable x with real coefficients is the field R(x) of rational functions in the variable x with real coefficients. The fraction field of the Gaussian integers.

Tuesday 2/19/13. First isomorphism theorem without surjectivity assumption: If f : R -> S is a ring homomorphism then f(R) is a subring of S and there is an induced isomorphism of rings g : R/ker(f) -> f(R) given by g(a+ker(f))=f(a). Examples: If f : Z -> R is the ring homomorphism (with domain the set Z of integers) determined by f(1)=1 then ker(f)=nZ for some n &ge; 0, and we get an isomorphism g : Z/nZ -> f(Z). If f : R[x,y] -> R[t] is the ring homomorphism given by f(x)=t<sup>2</sup>, f(y)=t<sup>3</sup> and f(a)=a for a in R (R = ring of real numbers), then ker(f) equals the principal ideal (x<sup>3</sup>-y<sup>2</sup>), the image f(R[x,y]) of f equals the subring S of R[t] consisting of polynomials p(t) such that p'(0)=0, and we get an isomorphism g: R[x,y]/(x<sup>3</sup>-y<sup>2</sup>) -> S. The ring Z[i]/(2+3i) is isomorphic to Z/13Z. The Chinese remainder theorem: Let R be a ring with 1 and I and J ideals of R such that I+J=R. Then the map f : R/I&cap;J -> R/I &oplus; R/J given by f(a + I &cap; J) = (a+I,a+J) is an isomorphism of rings. Example: R=Z, I=nZ, J=mZ, gcd(n,m)=1 gives the usual CRT isomorphism f: Z/nmZ -> Z/nZ &oplus; Z/mZ, f(a)= (a mod n, a mod m).

Friday 2/15/13. Example: The Frobenius homomorphism for (Z/pZ)[x]. The first isomorphism theorem for ring homomorphisms: If f : R -> S is a surjective ring homomorphism then there is an induced ring homomorphism g: R/ker(f) -> S given by g(a+ker(f))=f(a) which is an isomorphism (i.e. a bijective homomorphism). Examples: Evaluation at a real number a gives an isomorphism R[x]/(x-a)-> R, evaluation at i gives an isomorphism R[x]/(x^2+1)-> C, evaluation at 0 followed by reduction mod 2 gives an isomorphism Z[x]/(2,x)->Z/2Z.

Wednesday 2/13/13. The kernel of a ring homomorphism R -> S. The kernel is an ideal of R. Conversely, given an ideal I of R, the quotient map R -> R/I is a ring homomorphism with kernel I. If R is a ring with 1 then there is a unique ring homomorphism f: Z -> R with f(1)=1 (here Z denotes the ring of integers). We define the characteristic of R to be the integer n &ge; 0 such that ker(f) = nZ. If R is an integral domain then the characteristic of R is 0 or a prime p. If R is a commutative ring of characteristic p (a prime) then the map F : R -> R given by F(a)=a<sup>p</sup> is a ring homomorphism called the Frobenius homomorphism.

Monday 2/11/13. Correspondence theorem: The ideals of R/I are the quotients J/I where J is an ideal of R containing I. Corollary: R/I is a field iff I is a maximal ideal (i.e. I is not equal to R, and the only ideals containing I are I itself and R). Ring homomorphisms. Examples.
<br>
<br>
Friday 2/8/13. Examples of prime ideals: The prime ideals in Z are {0} and (p) for p a prime. The prime ideals in C[x] are {0} and (x-a) for a an element of C (here C=complex numbers). The prime ideals in Z[x] are more complicated: they include {0},(x), and (2,x) (which form a nested chain of length 2).
<br>
<br>
Wednesday 2/6/13. More examples of quotient rings: R[x]/(x-a) is isomorphic to R for a in R, R[x]/(x^2+1) is isomorphic to C (here R={real numbers}, C={complex numbers}).  Ideals generated by several elements. An example of a non-principal ideal: I=(2,x) in Z[x]. If R is a commutative ring with 1, not the trivial ring, then R is a field iff the only ideals are {0} and R. Prime ideals. If R is a commutative ring with 1 and I is an ideal of R, R/I is an integral domain iff I is prime.
