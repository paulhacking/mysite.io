The common midterm will be held on Wednesday 11/13/13, 7:00PM--8:30PM, in the following locations: 
<br>
<br>
Hasbrouck Lab. 134: 235.1 (Oblomkov)
<br>
Hasbrouck Lab. 020: 235.2 (Norman), 235.4 (Hacking), 235.5 (Wilson), 235.6 (Hatley)
<br>
Hasbrouck Lab. 126: 235.3 (Kusner). 
<br>
<br>
The syllabus for the common midterm is Chapters 1-4 and 6 of the textbook, with the emphasis being on Chapters 3,4 and 6.
<br>
<br>
There will be a review session for the common midterm on Tuesday 11/12/13, 7:00PM--8:30PM in Thompson 102. The review questions are <a href="common_midterm_review.pdf">here</a>. Solutions are <a href="common_midterm_review_solutions.pdf">here</a>. 
<br>
<br>
Please try the review questions before the review session! At the review session I will work through some of the review questions (based on student requests). But it is important to try the questions on your own first.
<br>
<br>
If you have a documented conflict for the common midterm you must give the course chair Paul Hacking <a href="mailto:hacking@math.umass.edu">hacking@math.umass.edu</a> at least one weeks' written notice in order to take the make-up exam. Other make-up exams (e.g. due to medical emergencies) will be handled by your section instructor.

<br>
235.2 (Norman) : Hasbrouck Lab. 124
<br>
235.3 (Kusner) : Hasbrouck Lab. 126
<br>
235.4 (Hacking) : LGRT 123
<br>
235.5 (Wilson) : Goessmann Lab. 51
